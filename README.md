# Procare Photo Downloader

This repository now contains three app targets:

- A Windows desktop app built with WPF on .NET 8
- A mobile app built with .NET MAUI for Android and iOS
- A Flutter mobile rewrite for Android and iOS

Both are focused on browsing and downloading full-resolution photos from Procare Connect at `schools.procareconnect.com`.

## Windows Desktop App

The Windows desktop app is the original WPF application in the repository.

### What It Does

- Uses the real Procare login flow in an embedded WebView2 browser
- Detects the authenticated API session without storing your password
- Lets you choose a student when multiple children are available
- Loads a photo gallery grouped by year and month
- Supports collapsible month sections and month-level selection
- Downloads full-resolution originals, not thumbnail images
- Tracks photos that were already saved and marks them in the gallery
- Adds a `Download Unsaved` action so repeat runs only fetch new photos
- Lets you choose how files are organized on disk from a settings screen
- Lets you import an existing download folder to backfill download history
- Lets you clear the current session and sign in with a different account

### Current Features

#### Gallery

- Student selection screen after login
- Photo thumbnails with lazy loading
- Month-by-month grouping such as `April 2026`
- Collapsible month sections
- `Select All` across the gallery
- `Select Month` per month group
- Saved badge for files already downloaded

#### Downloading

- Full-resolution photo downloads
- Parallel downloads with progress bar and per-file status
- Download selected photos
- Download only unsaved photos
- Skip previously downloaded photos safely

#### Save Layouts

Choose the layout from the in-app settings screen:

- `Single Folder`
- `Year / Month`
- `Student / Year`
- `Student / Year / Month`

Examples:

- `ChosenFolder\\2026\\04\\2026-04-10_12345.jpg`
- `ChosenFolder\\Nathan Lee\\2026\\04\\2026-04-10_12345.jpg`

#### Tracking and Logs

- Download history is stored locally so the app can identify previously saved photos
- Existing folders can be imported to mark older downloads as already saved
- Application logs are written locally for troubleshooting

Default local data paths:

- Logs: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\ProcareDownloader\\logs\\app.log`
- Download history: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\ProcareDownloader\\download-history.json`
- Settings: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\ProcareDownloader\\settings.json`
- WebView session data: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\ProcareDownloader\\WebView2Data`

## Mobile App

The repository also includes a separate .NET MAUI mobile app in `ProcareDownloader.Mobile`.
See `docs/plans/mobile-ux-modernization-plan.md` for the current mobile UX modernization plan.

Current scope:

- Android target
- iOS target
- Shared core logic with the desktop app for models, download history, settings, and file-layout rules

### Flutter Rewrite

The repo also includes a Flutter rewrite in `ProcareDownloader.Flutter`.

From that folder, you can run:

```powershell
cd ProcareDownloader.Flutter
flutter pub get
flutter run
flutter test
```

Current mobile status:

- Embedded login via Flutter `WebView`
- Student selection
- Timeline Explorer gallery grouped by day
- Background photo scanning with incremental timeline updates and progress
- Download selected new photos
- Export Setup sheet with save layout selection, output preview, history reset, and sign out

Important note:

- The mobile project is not the Windows app.
- The Windows desktop UI remains the WPF app.
- iOS packaging/signing still requires a Mac toolchain, even though the project is present in the solution.

## Requirements

### Windows Desktop

- Windows 10 or Windows 11
- .NET 8 SDK
- Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime

### Mobile

- .NET SDK with MAUI workloads
- Android workload for Android builds
- iOS workload plus a Mac toolchain for real iOS device/archive builds
- Flutter SDK for the Flutter rewrite

WebView2 is usually already installed on modern Windows systems. If not, install it from:

`https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/webview2/`

## Build and Run

### Windows Desktop

```powershell
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

To run the built executable directly:

```powershell
.\\bin\\Debug\\net8.0-windows\\ProcareDownloader.exe
```

You can also open `ProcareDownloader.csproj` in Visual Studio 2022 or later and run it with F5.

### Mobile

Build the MAUI mobile app:

```powershell
dotnet build ProcareDownloader.Mobile/ProcareDownloader.Mobile.csproj
```

Android example:

```powershell
dotnet build ProcareDownloader.Mobile/ProcareDownloader.Mobile.csproj -f net10.0-android
```

iOS example:

```powershell
dotnet build ProcareDownloader.Mobile/ProcareDownloader.Mobile.csproj -f net10.0-ios
```

## Windows Authentication Flow

1. The app opens the real Procare login page in WebView2.
2. After you sign in, the app watches authenticated browser traffic.
3. It captures the bearer token and organization context from the active session.
4. It uses that session to load students, activities, and photo originals.

The desktop app does not ask for or save your Procare password.

## Troubleshooting

### Windows WebView2 initialization failure

Install or repair the WebView2 Runtime.

### Windows student or photo loading failures

Check:

- `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\ProcareDownloader\\logs\\app.log`
- your current Procare session in the embedded browser
- whether Procare changed API responses or page behavior

### Previously saved photos are not marked

Open Settings and use `Import Existing Downloads Folder` on the folder tree that already contains downloaded images.

### Wrong account is still logged in

Open Settings and use `Log Out And Change Account`.

## Notes

- The app is intended for personal photo export from your own Procare account.
- Downloaded files are named with the photo date and photo id to make re-runs stable.
- The app is conservative about duplicates and will skip files already known in history.
